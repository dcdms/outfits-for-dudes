# Outfits for Dudes

Just a simple landing page for a homework. This app was built with HTML and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and we also used [Bun](https://bun.com) as the package manager.

## Running

You need to have Bun installed to run this website on your machine. Install it if you haven't already:

```sh
# For Linux & MacOS
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# For Windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Good! You can start the development server now:

```sh
bun start
```

The website should start at http://localhost:8080.
