# Outfits for Dudes

Just a simple landing page for a homework assignment. This app was built with HTML and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and we also used [Bun](https://bun.com) as the package manager.

## Running

> You must have [Bun](https://bun.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed to run this app on your machine. Enter their websites if you need install them.

Execute these commands to run this website locally: 

```sh
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dcdms/outfits-for-dudes

# enter its folder
cd outfits-for-dudes

# install its dependencies
bun i

# start the development server
bun start
```

Great! The website should start at http://localhost:8080.
